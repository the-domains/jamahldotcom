description: 'Werner Karl Heisenberg ( German: [ˈhaɪzənbɛɐ̯g]; 5 December 1901 - 1 February 1976) was a German theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics. He published his work in 1925 in a breakthrough paper. In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, during the same year, this matrix formulation of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated.'
